# QUICK INSTALLATION GUIDE
# DepEd Southern Leyte Division Library Log System

## STEP-BY-STEP INSTALLATION

### 1. PREPARE XAMPP
   - Make sure XAMPP is installed
   - Start Apache and MySQL from XAMPP Control Panel

### 2. CREATE DATABASE
   a. Open browser: http://localhost/phpmyadmin
   b. Click "Import" tab
   c. Choose file: database.sql
   d. Click "Go"
   e. Database "liblogs_db" will be created with 2 tables:
      - users (admin accounts)
      - logbook_entries (visitor logs)

### 3. COPY FILES TO XAMPP
   a. Go to: C:\xampp\htdocs\ (or your XAMPP location)
   b. Create folder: "library-system"
   c. Copy ALL files to this folder:
      - index.php
      - database.sql
      - README.md
      - admin/ folder (with all files inside)
      - config/ folder (with all files inside)

### 4. ACCESS THE SYSTEM
   Public Page: http://localhost/library-system
   Admin Login: http://localhost/library-system/admin/login.php

### 5. DEFAULT LOGIN
   Username: admin
   Password: admin123

## FOLDER STRUCTURE (MUST BE EXACT)
```
C:\xampp\htdocs\library-system\
├── index.php
├── database.sql
├── README.md
├── admin\
│   ├── login.php
│   ├── dashboard.php
│   ├── logout.php
│   └── export.php
└── config\
    ├── database.php
    └── session.php
```

## HOW IT WORKS

VISITOR SIDE:
- Visitor opens: http://localhost/library-system
- Fills in: Name, Client Type, Position, District, Purpose
- Clicks "SUBMIT LOG"
- Date and time are automatically recorded
- Single visit entry only (no time-out tracking)
- Done! No need to log out

ADMIN SIDE:
- Admin opens: http://localhost/library-system/admin/login.php
- Logs in with: admin / admin123
- Views all visitor logs in dashboard
- Can filter by date, name, or client type
- Can export logs to CSV
- Can delete entries if needed

## COMMON ISSUES

Problem: "Cannot connect to database"
Solution: Make sure MySQL is running in XAMPP

Problem: "Page not found"
Solution: Check if files are in correct folder (htdocs\library-system)

Problem: "Cannot login"
Solution: Make sure you imported database.sql first

Problem: "Table doesn't exist"
Solution: Re-import database.sql in phpMyAdmin
